Previous versions of our code used the Arduino MIDI Library from Francois

Our code incorporates ITP PhysComp MIDI example code:

Tom Igoe was exceedingly helpful throughout.  

Louise Foo and Natasha Dzurny showed us that our wires were backward, and 
made fun of us, and we appreciated it. 

Our entire Physical Computing class gave us ideas and encouragement.  Props.  
Also there was childlike joy and wonder, in there, somewhere.  

Massive amounts of digital fabrication help came from our ITP classmates: 
- Jay Zehngebot
- Dollee Bhatia
- Trent Rohner 
- Tak Cheung
- Ben Light 
- Robbie Tilton
- Mark Kleback
